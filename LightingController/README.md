NOTE: if you are just using the Arduino IDE, you only need the .INO file.  I built and managed this in Visual Micro (a Visual Studio plugin for Arduino)

If you want to use visual micro, you can download it here: http://www.visualmicro.com/

It is a great tool and much better than the normal Arduino IDE since it gives debugging as well as formatting and intellisense.
